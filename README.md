Dementia affects memory and thinking capability of a person so much that they interfere with your daily activities. It is a condition, not a disease, and its symptoms are common to many brain disorders. It can get worse over time.
Early detection and correct diagnosis can lead to disease-retarding therapies which can slow disease progression and reduce patient and caregiver stress and morbidities.

 Various Machine Learning algorithms are used for detecting dementia and tuned their hyperparamters as well are comared with their ensemble combinations. A user interfaceis created for the same.
