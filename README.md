Dementia detection using parameter optimization for multimodal datasets

=>Led data preprocessing and implemented diverse machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, KNN, and more for analysis.
=>Evaluated algorithm performance, identifying Naïve Bayes with 95.54% accuracy as the optimal model.
=>Conducted hyperparameter tuning and developed an ensemble model using stacking techniques to enhance accuracy.
=>Deployed the stack model for dementia detection, utilizing Python libraries like Flask, Pickle, and NumPy to create a user-friendly interface.
